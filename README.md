# Random Forest Classifier for Social Network Ads

This repository contains a Random Forest Classifier implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook to classify users based on Social Network Ads data.

## Dataset
**File:** `Social_Network_Ads.csv`
- Contains data on user demographics and purchase behavior.
- Key features include `Age`, `EstimatedSalary`, and `Purchased` (target variable).

## Project Structure
- `random forest classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the Random Forest Classifier.
- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluation.

4. Follow the notebook's instructions to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with feature scaling.
- Random Forest Classifier implementation for prediction.
- Visualization of model performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix).

## Results
- The classifier efficiently predicts whether a user purchased a product based on their age and estimated salary.
